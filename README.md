# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

From the USGS earthquake data set from JSON file: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. Additional information in form of popups when clicked.
